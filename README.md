# Sentiment-Comparison-twitter-live-data
Project created as part of my Masters program courses

Social media has now risen as the best platform for companies to understand the sentiment(Positive,negative or neutral) of their customers.
Businesses are always looking for ways to get immediate feedback from customers to understand the user satisfaction level for their products and services. Initially, customers would be asked to fill out a feedback form on paper or online for a set of questions to help the providers understand how happy they are with their products/services. However, this process of feedback collection may not always prove fruitful as many customers may miss to fill the forms or the standard questions in the form may not fully capture the sentiment of the client.

With the whole world looking to Social media to voice their opinion on anything and everything, Companies have started looking into these platforms to extract insights about customer sentiment about their services. Twitter is one of the most popular social media networks where on an average 6,000 tweets are published per second which corresponds to over 500 million tweets per day. 

Thus, we decided to use real-time live twitter data to track and compare the performance to two commercial giants Walmart and Costco. There is a constant debate online about which of the two is better and in which aspects. This analysis can give us insights to the better performer in each product and service. This can be used for understanding the sections where they are performing well and the ones where they need to improve. We have also compared the performance of the two companies in different regions namely New York and San Francisco.
